<h2 id="why-join">Why Join?</h2>

<p>Your membership in the Jackson County Cattlemen’s Association automatically affiliates you with like-minded men and women across the state, who are dedicated to humanely raising healthy cattle and promoting beef consumption. JCCA represents cattle owners of Jackson County in legislative and regulatory affairs. However, you do not have to be a cattle owner to join. Think of it as an easy way to stand for something greater: property and hunters’ rights, environmental work, keeping our family farms viable, and protecting our children and grandchildren’s futures.</p>

<p>We support government regulation of meat inspection standards, and manage our cattle using the high standards outlined in Beef Quality Assurance (BQA). We stand by property rights that allow us to discern how we use our land, and object to government regulations which inhibit those rights.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Free Meals: Members receive an invitation to our annual banquet and trade show in January. The banquet is free to members and their spouse and minor children. There is a small charge for any guests to the banquet.</p>

<p>Activities: Members are invited to any events we hold throughout the year, including trips, calf shows, and educational workshops.</p>

<p>Magazine Subscription: JCCA members receive a free subscription to the monthly magazine published by the Alabama Cattlemen’s Association.</p>

<p>Alabama Cattlemen’s Association Membership: Your membership in the JCCA, makes you a member of the ACA, and entitles you to all benefits of an ACA member, including great discounts, statewide.</p>
